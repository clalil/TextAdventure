//Chapter One
#start
Hello %%NAME%%! You are about to embark on a great adventure.
&beginGame: I'm psyched! Let's play 'House of the Haunted'.
===
#beginGame
You wake up in the middle of a forest, not remembering how you got there in the first place.
You are wearing your favourite clothes: a t-shirt and shorts. Perhaps you shouldn't be - 
it's about 10 degrees celcius in the woods. You feel kind of cold...and hungry, so hungry.
&goNorth: The darkness is surrounding you, creeping you out. You decide to get a move on.
&stay: You decide to stay where you are. Perhaps someone will come by soon and rescue you.
&exit: Go to exit
===
#goNorth
You start walking deeper into the woods. You feel a slight drizzle of rain and pick up the pace.
&exit: Go to exit
===
#stay
You sit down on the cold, hard ground. Awaiting rescue that might never come.
===
#exit
You leave the location
